                `\n\nTag Instruction:\n` +
                `  Embedded within this script, you may employ special tags to trigger various game mechanics. ` +
                `\n\n  Emotion tags ("[CHARACTER NAME expresses JOY]") should be used to indicate visible emotional shifts in a character's appearance using a single-word emotion name. ` +
                `\n\n  Appearance tags ("[CHARACTER NAME wears APPEARANCE NAME]") should be used when a character changes appearance. ` +
                    `When establishing a character at the beginning of a scene or when moving to this location with a movement tag, give special consideration to the inclusion of a 'wears' tag to explicitly call out an appropriate look. ` +
                    `APPEARANCE NAME must be found under the specified character—either their current appearance or one of their listed alternatives. ` +
                `\n\n  A Character movement tag ("[CHARACTER NAME moves to LOCATION]") must be used when an Absent Character enters the scene. ` +
                `\n\n  Character movement tags ("[CHARACTER NAME moves to LOCATION]") must also be included when a character leaves the scene or moves to a different module on the station. ` +
                `\n\n  Character movement tags ("[CHARACTER NAME moves to LOCATION]") are also used to move a character to another faction, abstractly representing any faction mission or time away. ` +
                `\n\n  A Scene movement tag ("[SCENE MOVES to MODULE NAME]") may be used when the scene itself transitions to another module. ` +
                `When this tag is used, all characters currently present in the scene are treated as relocating together. ` +
                `\n\n  For all Character movement tags, LOCATION should be the name of an existing module type (e.g., 'comms', 'infirmary', 'lounge'), a character's quarters (e.g., 'Susan's quarters' or just 'quarters' for their own), or simply "Here" to move to the scene's location or "Another module" to leave this area. ` +
                `If a faction name is used for the LOCATION, it indicates that the character is departing from the PARC itself, typically to visit a faction or engage in a mission or job on that faction's behalf (use the faction name as the location, even when the job is not "at" the faction). ` +
                `The game engine relies upon movement tags to update character locations and visually display character presence in scenes, so it is essential to use these tags when Absent Characters enter the scene, Present Characters leave, or the scene itself relocates. ` +
                `These tags are not presented to users, so the narrative content of the script should also organically mention characters entering, exiting, or relocating. ` +
                `\n\nThis scene is a brief visual novel skit within a video game; as such, the scene avoids major developments which would fundamentally alter the mechanics or nature of the game, ` +
